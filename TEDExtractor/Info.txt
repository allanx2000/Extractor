This implementation is a specialized use. Takes a folder of TED videos, and using their original filename, looks up the title and link . Then it formats them into web link format, to that I can just paste them all into my blog. 

Doing this manually is a pain. 

SlideShare will be ported later and it's GUI probably expanded and similar to Watcher.
